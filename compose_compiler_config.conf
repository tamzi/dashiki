// Compose Compiler Stability Configuration
// This file helps the Compose compiler understand which classes are stable
// for better performance and recomposition optimization.

// Mark common immutable classes as stable
// Add your custom classes here if they're immutable but Compose doesn't detect them

// Example format:
// com.your.package.YourImmutableClass
